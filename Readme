----------- Overview ----------- 
The GPS-Based Attendance System is a modern solution designed to simplify attendance tracking for organizations. 
Leveraging the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this system utilizes GPS technology and real-time location 
tracking to authenticate users and mark attendance accurately.

----------- Features ----------- 
MAC Address Authentication: Users' devices' MAC addresses are securely stored in the database during signup for future authentication.
Real-Time Location Tracking: The system verifies the user's location to ensure they are within the specified range set by the administrator before allowing attendance marking.
Efficient Attendance Management: Organizations can bid farewell to manual attendance processes and embrace a seamless, reliable, and efficient solution that saves time and reduces administrative burden.
